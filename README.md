# Fine-tuning SLM Dataset

We developed a specialized fine-tuning dataset for small language models to enhance high-level task configuration in underwater robotics. Through fine-tuning on this dataset, we significantly improved the parsing accuracy of small models for underwater robot task specifications. Experimental validation was conducted across four different small language models.
